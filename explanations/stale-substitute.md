The build log of this package indicates that a nix `substitute` function, such as `substituteInPlace`, was called but failed to match its pattern.

There may be a typo in the pattern, or it may be the case that the pattern being substituted has been changed in the upstream source such that it does not match anymore.

Please check the offending substituteInPlace for typos or changes in source.
